## My projects 

### Miso Mania ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)
Project carried out as part of the LIFAP4 course at Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University, as part of my second year of preparation for Polytech engineering schools (Peip). 
Miso Mania is a 2D platform game. It's a cross between a platform game and a die and retry. The player controls a character who must reach the end of the level. The game features a level editor, a level-sharing system and a leaderboard. 
Miso Mania allows the player to create a user in the game, and this user can buy skins for the character, as well as particles. Coins are earned by completing levels, and the closer the player gets to the top of the leaderboard, the more coins they earn. 
The game is distributed on WSL, Mac and Linux. The game was created using the SDL2 library and C++ by [Romain Rochebloine](https://github.com/rrrroo), [Mathieu Ponton](https://github.com/Claquettes) and myself.
For this project, we were ranked 9 out of 211 students, with a mark of 18.42/20.

Project carried out as part of the LIFABDW UE at the UniversitÃ© Claude Bernard Lyon 1, as part of my second year of preparation for the Polytech engineering schools (Peip). This project was carried out with [Mathieu Ponton](https://github.com/Claquettes). 
This project is a website, created using MVC architecture, that manages a dance school. It can be used to manage the school's students, teachers, classes, classrooms, etc. It can also be used to manage a dance federation, with management of dancers, competitions, results, etc. 
This project was created using PHP, HTML, CSS and MySQL. 
For this project, we were ranked 9 out of 59 groups, with a score of 16.25/20.

### Vehicle route optimisation ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)
Project carried out as part of my studies at Polytech Lyon, with [Maxime Antoine](https://github.com/maxime-antoine-dev), [Mathieu Ponton](https://github.com/Claquettes) and [Pablo VerchÃ¨re](https://github.com/PabloVerchere). 
The aim of the project was to develop a python program to find the shortest path between 100 points on a map. The project is a version of the Travelling Salesman Problem. The program allows the user to choose one or more trucks to deliver to a predefined number of points. 
The programme was developed using the Turtle python library, and the algorithms used are the nearest neighbour algorithm for the initial solution, 2-opt, relocate and swap for the local search. All the algorithms were developed in-house. 
The program has a graphical interface that shows the best path in real time. All the data was saved in .xlsx files to enable us to analyse the results. 
For this project, we were ranked 1 out of 40 groups, with a score of 19/20.

### 2048 ![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/php-%23777BB4.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=php&logoColor=white) ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white) ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)
This project is a 2048 game developed during my first year of pre-prep as part of the LiFASR2 UE at Lyon 1 University, using the fundamentals of web programming, such as PHP, HTML and CSS. 
The main aim is to create an interactive and entertaining experience by putting my initial knowledge of web development into practice. Thanks to the combination of these languages, I'm able to offer users a classic, responsive interface, allowing them to take up the challenge of 2048 while exploring the possibilities of web programming.
